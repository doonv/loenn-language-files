# Loenn Language File Highlighting

Adds syntax highlighting to [Loenn](https://github.com/CelestialCartographers/Loenn)'s `.lang` language files. That's all that it does.

## Known Issues

Only fully supports lines starting with `entities`, `triggers`, and `mod`. Lines starting with other things may not be highlighted properly.

If you have any other issues, you can create an issue here or ping Doonv#7063 on the [Celeste Discord](https://discord.gg/celeste).
